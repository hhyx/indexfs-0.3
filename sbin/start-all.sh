# Please run this script at the indexfs's home directory:
#   > sbin/start-all.sh
#
# Use this script to start an indexfs server cluster over the network.
# Root privilege is neither required nor recommended to run this scripts.
#
# Note that this script makes use of the 'sbin/start-idxfs.sh' to start
# each indexfs server on each participanting server node. Currently,
# we recommend to run 1 single indexfs server on 1 single machine.
#
# Note also that this script uses SSH to launch jobs on remote servers.
# Before using this script, please prepare your server list file at
# etc/indexfs-distributed/server_list, and make sure your "control node" can
# SSH to these servers without providing a password.
#
# Please also make sure that all servers have access to the same indexfs distribution
# and can access that with the same file system path. It is recommended to place
# the indexfs distribution on a shared file system, such as NFS.
